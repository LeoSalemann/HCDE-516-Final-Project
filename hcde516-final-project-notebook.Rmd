# Install & Load Supporting Packages
For reading csv files (readr), filtering data frame rows (tidyverse/dplyr)
```{r}
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("tidyverse")

library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
# library(stringr)
```
# Read Survey Data
Open the file; have a look.
```{r}
dfSurveyData <- read_csv("Audio_survey_November 10, 2020_18.47 - Audio_survey_November 10, 2020_18.47.csv")

head(dfSurveyData, n=10)
```

# Data Cleansing - Remove some junk
* Remove extra header rows
* Remove extra columns (Q5_1, Q5_2, Q5_3)
* View results
```{r}
dfSurveyData <- dfSurveyData[-c(1,2),]
dfSurveyData$Q5_1 <- NULL
dfSurveyData$Q5_2 <- NULL
dfSurveyData$Q5_3 <- NULL
dfSurveyData
```

# Data Cleansing -  Rename some columns
  - _Q13_ to _Consent_
  - _Q1_ to _AudioTopic_
  - _Q3_1_ to _LikertMotivated_
  - _Q3_2_ to _LikertTrustworty_
  - _Q3_3_ to _LikertSmart_
  - _Q7_ to _LikertInterview_
  - _Duration (in seconds)_ to _Duration_
```{r}
names(dfSurveyData)[names(dfSurveyData)=="Q13"]  <- "Consent"
names(dfSurveyData)[names(dfSurveyData)=="Q1"]   <- "AudioTopic"
names(dfSurveyData)[names(dfSurveyData)=="Q3_1"] <- "LikertMotivated"
names(dfSurveyData)[names(dfSurveyData)=="Q3_2"] <- "LikertTrustworty"
names(dfSurveyData)[names(dfSurveyData)=="Q3_3"] <- "LikertSmart"
names(dfSurveyData)[names(dfSurveyData)=="Q7"]   <- "LikertInterview"
names(dfSurveyData)[names(dfSurveyData)=="Duration (in seconds)"] <- "Duration"
dfSurveyData$Duration <- as.numeric(dfSurveyData$Duration)
dfSurveyData$Progress <- as.numeric(dfSurveyData$Progress)
dfSurveyData
```

# More Cleansing
* Filter out rows where participant did not agree to terms & conditions. (Q13).
* Filter out rows where duration is less than 35 seconds (adio clip is 30 seconds; reuore at least 1 second per question.)
* Filter out rows where clip was not about interview (Q1)
```{r}
dfSurveyData <- filter(dfSurveyData, !grepl("NOT",Consent))

dfSurveyData <- filter(dfSurveyData, Duration > 5) #should be 35
dfSurveyData <- filter(dfSurveyData, grepl("interview",AudioTopic))
dfSurveyData
```

# Create a SoundClip column
Take all the nina_clean, nina_phone, etc clips, and "compress" them into a single
column that identifies which clip was heard.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
