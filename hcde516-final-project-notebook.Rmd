## Step 1: Preparing and Loading Data
## Install & Load Supporting Packages
This is for reading csv files (readr), filtering data frame rows (tidyverse/dplyr), and data conversion (lubridate), source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41165867/r-convert-date-from-character-to-datetime
```{r}
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("lubridate")
install.packages("ggpubr") 
install.packages("rstatix")

library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggpubr)
library(rstatix)
```

## Read Survey Data
This is to open and read the .csv file.
```{r}
dfSurveyData <- read_csv("Audio_survey_November 25, 2020_20.09.csv")

head(dfSurveyData, n=10)
```

## Cleanse Data  
* Remove extra header rows
* Rename some Columns
  - _Q13_ to _Consent_
  - _Q1_ to _AudioTopic_
  - _Q13_1_ to _Trustworthiness_
  - _Q15_1_ to _Interview_
  - _Duration (in seconds)_ to _Duration_
* Change some string columns to numeric & dates
* View results

```{r}
dfSurveyData <- dfSurveyData[-c(1,2),]

names(dfSurveyData)[names(dfSurveyData)=="Q13"]  <- "Consent"
names(dfSurveyData)[names(dfSurveyData)=="Q1"]   <- "AudioTopic"
names(dfSurveyData)[names(dfSurveyData)=="Q13_1"] <- "Trustworthiness"
names(dfSurveyData)[names(dfSurveyData)=="Q15_1"]   <- "Interview"
names(dfSurveyData)[names(dfSurveyData)=="Duration (in seconds)"] <- "Duration"

dfSurveyData$Duration       <- as.numeric(dfSurveyData$Duration)
dfSurveyData$Progress       <- as.numeric(dfSurveyData$Progress)
dfSurveyData$Trustworthiness <- as.numeric(dfSurveyData$Trustworthiness)
dfSurveyData$Interview      <- as.numeric(dfSurveyData$Interview)

dfSurveyData$StartDate <- mdy_hms(dfSurveyData$StartDate)
dfSurveyData
```

## Cleanse Additional Data (i.e., filter some rows)
This is for filtering out rows in which...

* Participant _did not_ agree to terms & conditions (Q13)
* Duration is _less than 35 seconds_ (30 sec for listening; 5 sec for answering)
* Participant didn't say _topic of audio clip was an interview_
* _Trustworthiness_ or _Interview_ are _NA_
* Filter out rows where _StartDate is before Nov 13, 9:20AM MT_
* Filter out _survey = "Survey Preview"_
* Filter for _Finished = True_

Display results
```{r}
dfSurveyData <- filter(dfSurveyData, !grepl("NOT",Consent))
dfSurveyData <- filter(dfSurveyData, Duration > 35) #should be 35
dfSurveyData <- filter(dfSurveyData, grepl("interview",AudioTopic))
dfSurveyData <- filter(dfSurveyData, !is.na(Trustworthiness))
dfSurveyData <- filter(dfSurveyData, !is.na(Interview))
dfSurveyData <- filter(dfSurveyData, !grepl("Survey Preview",Status))
dfSurveyData <- filter(dfSurveyData, grepl("TRUE",Finished))
dfSurveyData <- filter(dfSurveyData, StartDate > ("2020-11-13 20:09:13"))
dfSurveyData
```

## Add Some Custom Columns
* _SoundClip_ identifies which clip the participant heard
* _Glitches_ counts how many glitches were the audio clip (0, 5, or 10)
* _PhoneFuzziness_ counts how many times the Audacity Telephone filter was applied (0, 1, 10)

Use mutate() and the %>%, source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4622060/case-statement-equivalent-in-r

```{r}

dfSurveyData <- dfSurveyData %>%
  mutate(.keep = "all", clip_type = case_when(
    .$`leo_clean` == "Yes" ~ "clean",
    .$`leo-phone-01` == "Yes" ~ "fuzz",
    .$`leo-phone-10` == "Yes" ~ "fuzz",
    .$`leo-glitch-05` == "Yes" ~ "glitch",
    .$`leo-glitch-10` == "Yes" ~ "glitch",
    TRUE ~ "unknown"
  )
)

dfSurveyData <- filter(dfSurveyData, clip_type != "unknown")

dfSurveyData <- dfSurveyData %>%
  mutate(.keep = "all", Glitches = case_when(
    .$`leo_clean` == "Yes" ~ 0,
    .$`leo-glitch-05` == "Yes" ~ 5,
    .$`leo-glitch-10` == "Yes" ~ 10,
    TRUE ~ -1
  )
)

dfSurveyData <- dfSurveyData %>%
  mutate(.keep = "all", PhoneFuzziness = case_when(
    .$`leo_clean` == "Yes" ~ 0,
    .$`leo-phone-01` == "Yes" ~ 1,
    .$`leo-phone-10` == "Yes" ~ 10,
    TRUE ~ -1
  )
)

dfSurveyData
```
## Confirm Number of Records Remaining
This is to obtain the row count for the whole data set.
```{r}
nrow(dfSurveyData)
```
There are a total of 93 records in the dataset that will be analyzed for this study.

## Step 2: Visualizing the Data

## Create Boxplot for Trustworthiness vs. Clip Type (Clean, Fuzzy, Glitchy)
```{r}
boxplot(Trustworthiness~clip_type, data = dfSurveyData)
```

## Create Boxplot for Willingness to Interview vs. Clip Type (Clean, Fuzzy, Glitchy)
```{r}
boxplot(Interview~clip_type, data = dfSurveyData)
```

## Determine Number of Records in Each Clip Type
```{r}
nrow(dfSurveyData[dfSurveyData$clip_type == "clean",])
nrow(dfSurveyData[dfSurveyData$clip_type == "fuzz",])
nrow(dfSurveyData[dfSurveyData$clip_type == "glitch",])
```

## Step 3: Checking Assumptions (i.e., outliers, normality, homogneity of variance assumption)
This is to determine whether the data is appropriate for ANOVA and Tukey HSD, source: https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/anova-in-r/#check-assumptions

## Check Outliers (in Trustworthiness)
```{r}
dfSurveyData %>% group_by(clip_type) %>% identify_outliers(Trustworthiness) 
```
As related to Trustworthiness, there are TWO outliers. However, neither of them are extreme outliers, so they were not removed from the dataset.

## Check Outliers (in Willingness to Interview)
```{r}
dfSurveyData %>% group_by(clip_type) %>% identify_outliers(Interview) 
```
As related to Willingness to Interview, there are THREE outliers. One of these is an extreme outliers; however, it represents 1% of the entire dataset. Therefore, none of the records were removed from the dataset.

## Check Normality (in Trustworthiness)
```{r}
ggqqplot(dfSurveyData, "Trustworthiness", facet.by = "clip_type")
```
Majority of the data points are approximately within the reference line, assuming normality of the data.

## Check Normality (in Willingness to Interview)
```{r}
ggqqplot(dfSurveyData, "Interview", facet.by = "clip_type")
```
Majority of the data points are approximately within the reference line, assuming normality of the data.

## Check Homogneity of Variance Assumption (in Trustworthiness)
```{r}
dfSurveyData %>% levene_test(Trustworthiness ~ clip_type)
```
The p-value is >0.05, which is not significant. There is no significant difference between variances across group, assuming homogeneity of variances.

## Check Homogneity of Variance Assumption (in Willingness to Interview)
```{r}
dfSurveyData %>% levene_test(Interview ~ clip_type)
```
The p-value is >0.05, which is not significant. There is no significant difference between variances across group, assuming homogeneity of variances.

## Step 4: Conducting Statistical Analyses

## Conduct One Way ANOVA (Trustworthiness)
```{r}
res.aov <- aov(Trustworthiness ~ clip_type, data = dfSurveyData)
summary(res.aov)
```
Using a One Way ANOVA, the p-value is <0.05 suggesting there is significant difference among the means of the clip type groups.

## Conduct Post Hoc Test, Tukey HSD (Trustworthiness)
```{r}
TukeyHSD(res.aov)
```
After conducting Tukey HSD, the only statistical significance is between the Glitch and Fuzz group.

## Conduct One Way ANOVA (Willingness to Interview)
```{r}
res.aov2 <- aov(Interview ~ clip_type, data = dfSurveyData)
summary(res.aov2)
```
Using a One Way ANOVA, the p-value is <0.05 suggesting there is significant difference among the means of the clip type groups.

## Conduct Post Hoc Test, Tukey HSD (Willingness to Interview)
```{r}
TukeyHSD(res.aov2)
```
After conducting Tukey HSD, there is statistical significance between the Clean and Glitch as well as Glitch and Fuzz group.
